### Notes
There were a few very tiny differences between the walkthrough video and my project since I'm assuming XCode or Swift has been through some changes. Other than that, the tutorial videos were extremely easy to follow and if there were any errors I had, it was because I forgot a step or didn't notice a small detail in the tutorial.
